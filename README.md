# Xcode Project Renamer

**Swift script for renaming Xcode project**

It should be executed from inside root of Xcode project directory and called with two string parameters: 
**$OLD_PROJECT_NAME** & **$NEW_PROJECT_NAME**

Script goes through all the files and directories recursively, including Xcode project or workspace file and replaces all occurrences of **$OLD_PROJECT_NAME** string with **$NEW_PROJECT_NAME** string (both in each file's name and content).

Renaming of project directory and Xcode project/workspace defaults to use FileManager.
For git-managed projects, append optional flag `--use-git` to leverage `git mv $OLD $NEW` instead.

## Usage

```bash
# download script and make it executable
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appculture/xcode-project-renamer/master/Sources/main.swift -o rename.swift && chmod +x rename.swift

# run script
$ ./rename.swift "$OLD_PROJECT_NAME" "$NEW_PROJECT_NAME"
# $ ./rename.swift "$OLD_PROJECT_NAME" "$NEW_PROJECT_NAME" --use-git

# remove script
$ rm rename.swift
```
